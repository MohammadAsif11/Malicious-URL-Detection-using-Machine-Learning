🔍 Malicious URL Detection using Machine Learning

🚀 Cyber threats are evolving—so should our defense! This project utilizes Machine Learning to detect malicious URLs, preventing phishing attacks, malware distribution, and scams. Using a powerful combination of

Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Forest (DF), and Random Forest (RF), the model identifies suspicious URLs with high accuracy and minimal false positives.

🌟 Why This Project?

Cybercriminals exploit malicious URLs to deceive users and deploy malware. Traditional blacklists fail against new threats, so we use machine learning to analyze URL structures, content, and hosting details in 

real-time.


🚀 Key Features

✅ Intelligent URL Analysis – Examines lexical, host-based, and content-based attributes.

✅ Multi-Model Approach – Uses SVM for pattern recognition, DF for rule-based learning, and Random Forest for ensemble decision-making.

✅ High Performance – Optimized for accuracy, precision, and recall, reducing false positives.

✅ Scalable & Fast – Can be integrated into security tools, browser extensions, and APIs.

✅ Real-Time Detection – Works dynamically to classify URLs without relying on outdated blacklists.
